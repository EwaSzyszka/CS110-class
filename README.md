HAT CHECK

An attendant at a party of N people receives everyoneâ€™s hats. 
However he forgets whose hat belongs to whom. 
Rather than admit his mistake, he simply gives random hats back to everyone.
This code is a simulation that checks how many hats he returned correctly

HIRE ASSISTANT

You need to hire a new assistant. Every day an agency sends a new assistant for you to interview. 
If the assistant is better than your current assistant then you hire them. 
(Assistant quality is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.)
This code is a simulation that calculates how many hires there will happen given the conditions.


---------------------------- merge sort ----------------------------

The code implements 2-way merge sort, 3-way merge sort and augmented merge sort,
that also has insertion sort implemented within it


---------------------------- worse-shuffle ----------------------------

This file contains an implementation of a worse shuffler on earth, that keeps shuffling randomly until it gets 
a sorted list.

---------------------------- median finder ----------------------------

This is a function that finds an approximation of a median of a function by selecting numbers from a list at 
random that fall in the percentile range
