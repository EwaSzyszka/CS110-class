HAT CHECK

However he forgets whose hat belongs to whom. 
Rather than admit his mistake, he simply gives random hats back to everyone.
This code is a simulation that checks how many hats he returned correctly

HIRE ASSISTANT

You need to hire a new assistant. Every day an agency sends a new assistant for you to interview. 
If the assistant is better than your current assistant then you hire them. 
(Assistant quality is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.)
This code is a simulation that calculates how many hires there will happen given the conditions.
